## What's new in 1.2.0

Nether stars/beacons are **no longer required**. Instead, you have to capture a ghast to light up your chunk loaders:

New configs are also added for you to control how chunk loaders behave on contraptions.

## Features

- 2 tiers of chunk loaders
    - Brass chunk loader: configurable loading range (1x1 to 5x5)
    - Andesite chunk loader: loads a single chunk
- Works on the ground and on contraptions
  - Configurable via server configs
  - Toggleable in-game via contraption controls
- Reliable chunk loading and unloading
- No leftover chunks being loaded forever
- Configs for speed requirements and unloading delay
- Ponder scenes available

*If the provided crafting recipes do not suit your needs, you can override the provided recipes by creating your own datapack.*
