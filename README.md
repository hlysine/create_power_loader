## What's new in 1.3.0

**Train Station attachment**

You can now attach Chunk Loaders to a Train Station to only load chunks when a train arrives!

New configs are added for you to toggle this function on the andesite/brass chunk loader.

**Reliable interdimensional chunk loading**

The entire chunk loading logic has been rewritten to take dimensions into account, and chunk loaders on trains now use
Create's track graph to provide reliable chunk loading.

## Features

- 2 tiers of chunk loaders
    - Brass chunk loader: configurable loading range (1x1 to 5x5)
    - Andesite chunk loader: loads a single chunk
- Works on the ground, on trains and on contraptions
    - Configurable via server configs
    - Toggleable in-game via contraption controls
- Attaches to Train Stations for lag-friendly chunk loading
- Reliable chunk loading and unloading
- Lots of configs for customization
- Complete ponder scenes
